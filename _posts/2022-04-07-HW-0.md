Discussion activity for today with Jekyll 

Let's start with markdown text. 
### Exploratory analysis 

1. **bold text**
2. *italic text*

- bullets

1. You can read the data into python by running:

```python 
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
 2. You can display the first 5 rows of the data to observe what the data looks like by running: `penguins.head()`
 (Then, you can determine which columns are most relevant for analysis)

3. You can drop NA values for the columns "Body Mass(g)" and "Sex" by running
 ```python
 penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Body Mass (g)", "Sex"])
 ```
