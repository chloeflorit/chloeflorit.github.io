  In this blog post, I’m going to make a super cool web scraper… Here’s a link to my [project repository](https://github.com/chloeflorit/homework2webScraping).


# Creating Your Scraper

## §1. Reading the data and creating a class
You can read the data into python by running: `import scrapy`.

You will create a class called `ImdbSpider` that inherits from `scrapy.Spider`.

Give your class a name, and tell it at which url to start. 

```python
class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider' #name of class
    #start url (the imdb of the tv show Downton Abby)
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606375/'] 
    
```

## §2. Parse method
Create a parse method in the `ImdbSpider` class. 

The parse method navigates from the movie page to the cast and crew page. 
Then we will call the `parse_full_credits` method, which will go to each actors' webpage. 
``` python 
def parse (self,response):
        """
        navigates from the movie page of Downton Abbey 
        to the cast and crew page
        """
        castCrewPageVar = 'fullcredits' 
        #url to access the full credits 
        nextCastCrewPage = response.urljoin(castCrewPageVar) 
        if nextCastCrewPage:
            yield scrapy.Request(nextCastCrewPage, 
                callback = self.parse_full_credits) 
```

## §3. Parse full credits method
The parse full credits method will go to each of the actors' webpages on IMDB. 
Then it will call the parse_actor method which will look at the filmography for each actor. 
 ```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
    """
    returns the link of the webpage for each actor in the TV show Downton Abbey
    """
        links = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]
        
        for link in links: #accesses the webpage for each actor and then calls the parse_actor_page method
            specificCastPage = response.urljoin(link)
            yield scrapy.Request(specificCastPage,
            callback = self.parse_actor_page)
 ```
 
## §4. Parse actor page method
The `parse_actor_page` takes the filmography of each actor's page and generates a table with the actors' name and the actors' movies. 
```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        """
        Variables:
        actorName which finds the name of the actor
        movieTitles retrieves all movie titles 

        the method creates a dictionary with each actor's name and 
        each of the movies in their filmography

        """
        actorName = response.css("span.itemprop::text ").get()
        movieTitles = response.css("div.filmo-row b a::text ").getall()

        # puts the movie name and actor name in a dictionary
        for movie in movieTitles:  
            yield {
                "Actor":actorName,
                "Movie/TV Show": movie
            }
        
```
