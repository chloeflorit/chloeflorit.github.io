  In this post, I'll show how to conduct exploratory anaysis create your own scatterplot.  


# Exploratory analysis 

# Reading the data
You can read the data into python by running:

```python 
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url) #reads the data
```

# Displaying the data 
You can display the first 5 rows of the data to observe what the data looks like by running: `penguins.head()`
 (Then, you can determine which columns are most relevant for analysis)

# Dropping NA values
You can drop NA values for the columns "Body Mass(g)" and "Sex" by running
 ```python
 penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Body Mass (g)", "Sex"])
 ```
 
# Changing specie names 
Each species has a long name. To shorten that name, we will only consider the first word of each species. 
You can rename each species with the first word of their respective species name by running 
```python
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```

# Cleaning the sex rows
We only want to consider the rows the sex is not "." To do so, you can run:

```python
penguins = penguins[penguins["Sex"] != "."] #only considers rows where the sex is not .
```

# Considering specific columns
We just want to consider specific columns. For example, you can only consider the following columns (Species, Island, Sex, Culmen Length (mm), Culmen Depth (mm), Flipper Length (mm), Body Mass (g)) (or other columns if you prefer). 

```python
cols = ["Species", "Island", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"] 
penguins = penguins[cols] #the dataset only considers the specific columns
```

# Creating your own scatter plot
You can create your own scatter plot by running: 

```python
fig = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins, 
                 x = "Culmen Length (mm)",#label of x-axis
                 y = "Culmen Depth (mm)", #label of y-axis
                 color = "Species", #color is determined by specific species
                 width = 700, #width of image
                 height = 450, #height of image
                 title = "Scatter plot of penguin species based on culmen depth and culmen length")
```
# Displaying your image
To show the figure, you can run `fig.show()`
